# Week 20 - Evolutionary Modelling

**Topics covered this week:** Evolutionary modelling (Gene drive and its potential use for malaria control; simulating evolutionary models including adapted Wright-Fisher; theory of models of drift and selection including their dynamics).

Project structure: In the code directory there are several R scripts exploring evolutionary models (described below).

Languages: R (version 4.1.2).

Required R packages: `doParallel`.

## Code Files:

* [**wright-fisher.R**](code/wright-fisher.R)
  * A basic Wright-Fisher model simulator, used to explore allele persistence time and effective population size.

* [**drift_migration.R**](code/drift_migration.R)
  * An extended Wright-Fisher simulator which includes migration as well as drift; exploring F<sub>st</sub> over time.

* [**gene-drive.R**](code/gene_drive.R)
  * A gene-drive simulator and challenges involving optimising outcomes of an introduced transgene for mosquito population suppression.

* [**tutorial2.R**](code/tutorial2.R)
  * Script assisting written work on evolutionary models.
