    \subsection{Schwarz weight}
    
        Schwarz weights were in agreement with Akaike weights that the modified Gompertz model is most likely to be the best model in this set (Figure \ref{Sfig: Schwarz in log space} and Figure \ref{fig: Akaike in log space}).

        \end{figure}

    \subsection{Not-log space}
    
        When residuals were calculated in not-log space, the resulting selection criteria suggested that the logistic model was best followed by the cubic model (Figures \ref{Sfig: counts in not-log space} and \ref{Sfig: Schwarz in not-log space}, Figure \ref{fig: Akaike in not-log space}). This difference when compared with log-space may be caused by the relative weighting of different sections of the growth curve.

            \caption{Counts of how many times each model was considered best in terms of having the lowest AIC\textsubscript{C} and BIC (calculated in not-log space). The best model is that which has the lowest value, models which are less than 2 higher than this are not different to the best model and so have also been counted as best.}
