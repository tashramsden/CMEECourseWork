## Into the wild!

# linear model = this can do everything! (mostly...)
# aim to collect quantitative data!!!

# IF RESPONSE var factorial, ranked (not continuous numeric)
# sometimes unavoidable - not good

# people will come to diff results from models - key thing make sure 
# assumptions robust
# qualitative meaning of the quantitative data should be similar

# expect:
# heterogeneous data
# dirty data
# data needing restructuring/w missing values
# data not matching hypothesis (maybe change question...)
# too small sample size
## work within yours means and w knowledge of potential limitations
# to your inference
