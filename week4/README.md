# Week 4

**Topics covered this week:** Statistics in R, mostly using data on sparrows - "Stats with Sparrows"!

Languages: R (version 4.1.1)

Project structure: 5 R script files in the code directory (described below), which will manipulate files from the data directory. 

Required R packages: `ggplot2`, `dplyr`, `WebPower`, `lme4`.

## Code Files:

* [**day1_sparrows_stats.R**](code/day1_sparrows_stats.R)
  * **Topics covered:** Basic stats; centrality and spread; data types; precision and standard error; comparing means.

* [**day2_sparrows_stats.R**](code/day2_sparrows_stats.R)
  * **Topics covered:** Errors and statistcial power; degrees of freedom; linear algebra; linear models.

* [**day3_sparrows_stats.R**](code/day3_sparrows_stats.R)
  * **Topics covered:** R squared, covariance and correlation; more linear model work.

* [**day4_sparrows_stats.R**](code/day4_sparrows_stats.R)
  * **Topics covered:** Anova, mean squares and variances; repeatability; linear mixed models.

* [**day5_sparrows_stats.R**](code/day5_sparrows_stats.R)
