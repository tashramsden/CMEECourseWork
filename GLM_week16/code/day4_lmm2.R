# data on unicorns - now have bodymass, size, hornlength, 
# but also were able to quantify the amount of glitz

# captured 100 unicorns, all of them more than once, all variables measured at every occasion
# scored reproductive fitness - unicorns can give birth every month, litter sizes 
# vary between 1-11
# was not always possible to scroe repro fitness, if females elusive
# also determined family groups
# and behavioural obs: counted amounts of copulations 

# hypotheses:
# 1) There is sexual dimorphism (trimorphism!) in unicorn body mass, size, and horn
# length
# 2) Heavy unicorns, corrected for sex and glizz, have longer horns
# We also believe that horns are a signalling quality in unicorns. We are not sure if it's
# sexually selected, or maybe something very different or odd. Therefore, we think that
# 3) Unicorns with longer horns are more likely to mate multiply than unicorns with
# shorter horns and
# 4) Unicorns with longer horns have a higher fitnessGiven that glizz seems to play an important role in unicorn biology, we also postulate that
# 5) Glizz is an indicator of quality, and more glizz means a unicorn can secure more
# copulations
# 6) Therefore, unicorns with more glizz have a higher fitness
# 7) All of this really suggests that of course, we assume that the more a unicorn mates, the
# higher its fitness.

# since >1 datapoint for each indiv, need to correct for psuedoreplication
# use random effect - grouping for indiv unicorn

# also have family groups - don't know if these have effect - need to see whether this needs to be corrected for
# to do this, can use LMR test
# 10 diff families (so don't want family as fixed factor - lose many df)
# so family is random effect

## 1.1 - body mass ----
# simple linear model won't do - pseudorep
# 100 indivs - so cannot use as fixed factors!
# -> lmm w indiv as random effect to account for pseudorep

h1m1 <- lmer(Bodymass ~ Sex + (1|Individual), data=d)
summary(h1m1)
# summary stats confirm that no effect of sex on body mass
# no p vals for lmm, but can look at param ests and corresponding SE
# Sexmale: -0.1, SE 0.15 -- the SE LARGER than the estimate & t val << 2

# maybe variation within and between families clouds the picture...
# add family as a random factor:
h1m2 <- lmer(Bodymass ~ Sex + (1|Individual) + (1|Family), data=d)
summary(h1m2)
# seems that family explains nearly as much variance as individual
# but st dev also quite large

# use likelihood ratio test to see if adding this param improves model:
lrtest(h1m1, h1m2)
# adding an extra param improves the fit stat significantly
# LogLikelihood of the reduced model without family is -2647, and the 
# LogLikelihood of the model with family as random effect is -2630,
# thus 17 units higher
# Chisq test supports this, w v low p value

# SO when running body mass, need to include family and indiv!
# but be aware - st dev  of random effects is BIG - suggests that diff between both/the ratio (indiv/group)
# is uncertain - don't build big hypothesis based on these exact nums!

# Methods: To test the hypotheses that body mass of unicorns is sexually trimorphic, we buld
# a linear mixed model with body mass as response variable. We modelled sex as three-level
# fixed factor (with female as reference). Each unicorn was measured 20 times, and to
# account for this pseudoreplication, we added individual identity as a random effect on the
# intercept. Family group explained a large amount of variation and was added as a random
# effect on the intercept to account for the nested structure of the data.
# 
# Results: We found no sexual trimorphism in body mass, as the mean values for body mass
# did not differ from each other. The mean for females was 0.14Â±0.27SE (in z-score SD units),
# and male and sex_notsure did not statistically differ from this. The random factor individual
# explained 28% of the variation, and the family group structure explaied 26% of the total
# variation in body mass. We kept family group in the final model because a likelihood-ratio
# test testing this against a model without family revealed that the reduced model explained
# variance statisctically significantly less well (chi-square=33.06, df=1 p<0.001).

# that body mass is not sig diff for diff sexes
# but what about glitz?

## hypothesis 3 ----
